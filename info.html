         <h3>Prospecting the Urban Mines of Amsterdam (PUMA)</h3>
         <p>
            The buildings of Amsterdam contain tons of steel, copper, aluminum and lead. Amsterdam can be seen
            as an urban mine. In a circular economy, under certain conditions, Amsterdam's buildings could be
            mined for their metals. This visualisation is a rough draft of a geological prospecting map in such a
            scenario.
         </p>
           
            <br>
            
         <p>
            Obviously, the metals are still in use, so they're not free to process just yet. It will take time before they
            can be extracted. But, in the mining industry, this is business as usual – getting any mine running takes
            decades. Traditionally, mines are underground. The earth contains iron, copper and aluminum. But ore
            concentrations are going down, and it takes more and more energy to get the metals out. Worldwide, 7-
            8% of all energy consumption is used to produce metals. It takes far less energy to take the metals from
            urban mines. Still, we have to ask: can it be done? And is it worthwhile?
         </p>
           
            <br>
            
         <p>
            The first step in any mining process is prospecting, that is, physically searching for minerals and
            precious metals. To start, we need to make a geological map of the urban environment. Where are the
            metals? How much is there? What is the quality? When will these metals become available?

         <h4>Sustainable Amsterdam</h4> 
         <p>
            “Effective use of raw materials is one of the focal points in the first sustainability programme in the
            city of Amsterdam”, is a quote from “Amsterdam Definitely Sustainable” (Amsterdam Beslist
            Duurzaam, 2011-2014). According to this plan, the effective use of raw materials involves thinking in
            cycles. In the document, “De Circulaire Metropool Amsterdam” (2014), the intention is to convert
            Amsterdam to a circular economy for materials. <a class="info-button" href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/bestuur-organisatie/volg-beleid/agenda-duurzaamheid/circulaire-economie/" target="_blank">“Amsterdam Circulair”</a> (2015) lays out a first roadmap
            specifically for the urban environment and biomass.

         <h4>PUMA project</h4> 
         <p>
            The PUMA project attempted to estimate of the rough amount of copper and iron contained in the
            residential buildings of Amsterdam (based on proxies like height of the building).
         </p>
           
            <br>  
            
         <h4>Data and concentration estimates</h4> 
         <p>
            The map and calculations are based on open data and a calculation based on a method by Koutamanis
            et al. Their steps can be found in the article "[The PUMA – from building to urban mine]"(/data/PUMA_from_building_to_urban_mine.pdf) (draft 2016).
